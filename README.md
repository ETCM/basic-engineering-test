Ensure that all features are green.

Phase 4 - Software Engineers
----------------------------
The calculator is a tinker toy. Make it do something interesting.

The code should be well factored after you are done with it and there should
be unit tests. Write about which unit testing framework you picked, how to
test with it and why you picked it here:

Additionally, you must add sufficient feature coverage.
